# Prediction-Market-Agents-Simulations

Team project for exploring multi-agent prediction markets inside the
AgentSocietyChallenge environment. Our scope is building the simulator shell
that coordinates synthetic data streams, source portals, betting agents, an
order-book-based market, and evaluation hooks so the rest of the team can plug
in their components.

For details on the simulator skeleton and how to integrate other modules, see
`docs/SIMULATOR_SKELETON.md`.
